Both outputs had actual k values of 20 like the previous model before the optimization."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"background_save":true},"id":"TGZdaNsiAjDC"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["[3, 10, 24, 30, 36]"]},"execution_count":122,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["sim_item_item_optimized.get_neighbors(0, k = 5)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"background_save":true},"id":"y0UfRXQNAzCL"},"outputs":[],"source":["recommendations = get_recommendations(df_final, 6958, 5, sim_item_item_optimized)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"background_save":true},"id":"PFomA9rDBee-"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["\n","  \u003cdiv id=\"df-6848f86a-3688-486e-8186-0828761145eb\"\u003e\n","    \u003cdiv class=\"colab-df-container\"\u003e\n","      \u003cdiv\u003e\n","\u003cstyle scoped\u003e\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","\u003c/style\u003e\n","\u003ctable border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\"\u003e\n","  \u003cthead\u003e\n","    \u003ctr style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003e\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003esong_id\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003epredicted_play_count\u003c/th\u003e\n","    \u003c/tr\u003e\n","  \u003c/thead\u003e\n","  \u003ctbody\u003e\n","    \u003ctr\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003e0\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e9942\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e2.048219\u003c/td\u003e\n","    \u003c/tr\u003e\n","    \u003ctr\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003e1\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e2842\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e1.949116\u003c/td\u003e\n","    \u003c/tr\u003e\n","    \u003ctr\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003e2\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e3050\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e1.885211\u003c/td\u003e\n","    \u003c/tr\u003e\n","    \u003ctr\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003e3\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e4939\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e1.771190\u003c/td\u003e\n","    \u003c/tr\u003e\n","    \u003ctr\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003e4\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e1691\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e1.743513\u003c/td\u003e\n","    \u003c/tr\u003e\n","  \u003c/tbody\u003e\n","\u003c/table\u003e\n","\u003c/div\u003e\n","      \u003cbutton class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-6848f86a-3688-486e-8186-0828761145eb')\"\n","              title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","              style=\"display:none;\"\u003e\n","        \n","  \u003csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n","       width=\"24px\"\u003e\n","    \u003cpath d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\" fill=\"none\"/\u003e\n","    \u003cpath d=\"M18.56 5.44l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm-11 1L8.5 8.5l.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94L8.5 2.5l-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm10 10l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94z\"/\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M17.41 7.96l-1.37-1.37c-.4-.4-.92-.59-1.43-.59-.52 0-1.04.2-1.43.59L10.3 9.45l-7.72 7.72c-.78.78-.78 2.05 0 2.83L4 21.41c.39.39.9.59 1.41.59.51 0 1.02-.2 1.41-.59l7.78-7.78 2.81-2.81c.8-.78.8-2.07 0-2.86zM5.41 20L4 18.59l7.72-7.72 1.47 1.35L5.41 20z\"/\u003e\n","  \u003c/svg\u003e\n","      \u003c/button\u003e\n","      \n","  \u003cstyle\u003e\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      flex-wrap:wrap;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  \u003c/style\u003e\n","\n","      \u003cscript\u003e\n","        const buttonEl =\n","          document.querySelector('#df-6848f86a-3688-486e-8186-0828761145eb button.colab-df-convert');\n","        buttonEl.style.display =\n","          google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
