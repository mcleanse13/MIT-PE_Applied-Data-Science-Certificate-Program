The evaluation will be as per the Rubric shared for each Milestone. Unlike previous courses, it does not follow the pattern of the graded questions in different sections. This notebook would give you a direction on what steps need to be taken to get a feasible solution to the problem. Please note that this is just one way of doing this. There can be other 'creative' ways to solve the problem, and we encourage you to feel free and explore them as an 'optional' exercise.\n","*   In the notebook, there are markdown cells called Observations and Insights. It is a good practice to provide observations and extract insights from the outputs.\n","*   The naming convention for different variables can vary. Please consider the code provided in this notebook as a sample code.\n","*   All the outputs in the notebook are just for reference and can be different if you follow a different approach.\n","*   There are sections called Think About It in the notebook that will help you get a better understanding of the reasoning behind a particular technique/step.
