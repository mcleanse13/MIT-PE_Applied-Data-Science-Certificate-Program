Project Overview: Python Exploratory Data Analysis on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

This project was completed as part of the Foundations of Data Science course and focuses on building essential skills in Python programming, statistics, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, the project emphasizes working with real-world health data to extract meaningful observations and develop a strong understanding of critical analytical concepts. Throughout the project, core Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are used to manipulate data, compute descriptive statistics, and create insightful visualizations. The assignment reinforces best practices for clean, well-documented, and reproducible analysis using Jupyter notebooks.

The analysis explores key health indicators that includes glucose levels, pregnancies, blood pressure, BMI, and insulin, examining how these variables relate to diabetes outcomes in female patients of Pima Indian heritage. By summarizing dataset characteristics, detecting patterns, and visualizing distributions, the project helps build foundational EDA skills required for more advanced data science coursework. This repository includes the full exploratory analysis, answers to guided questions, and detailed documentation demonstrating statistical understanding and practical analytical techniques relevant to healthcare data contexts.
