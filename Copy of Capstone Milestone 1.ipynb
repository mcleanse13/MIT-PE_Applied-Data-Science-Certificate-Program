The evaluation will be as per the Rubric shared for each Milestone. Unlike previous courses, it does not follow the pattern of the graded questions in different sections. This notebook would give you a direction on what steps need to be taken to get a feasible solution to the problem. Please note that this is just one way of doing this. There can be other 'creative' ways to solve the problem, and we encourage you to feel free and explore them as an 'optional' exercise.\n","\n","-In the notebook, there are markdown cells called Observations and Insights. It is a good practice to provide observations and extract insights from the outputs.\n","\n","-The naming convention for different variables can vary. Please consider the code provided in this notebook as a sample code.\n","\n","-All the outputs in the notebook are just for reference and can be different if you follow a different approach.\n","\n","-There are sections called Think About It in the notebook that will help you get a better understanding of the reasoning behind a particular technique/step.

My guess is that many users just listen to music casually without repeating songs or the recommendation system in place from past interactions isn't entirely suited to their music interests.\n","*   There is a much smaller number of unique songs in the revised dataset which indicates that they are getting a lot of users listening to them. Maybe these are attractive songs for the recommendation system to suggest in terms of past interactions but not popular songs in the mainstream where they will receive more than one listen on a streaming service.\n","*   The total number of unique artists is even smaller than the unique songs so based off the revised dataset maybe these are lesser known artists in terms of popularity or its possible they don't have much music available in the dataset. Maybe they also did not receive enough listens of their music so they did not show up in the condensed dataset.\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"o3d8ft3cndqE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Let's find out about the most interacted songs and interacted users**\n","\n","Most interacted songs"],"metadata":{"id":"jjbkN24fHuPR"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["most_rated = df_final.groupby('song_id').size().sort_values(ascending = False)[:10]\n","most_rated"],"metadata":{"id":"PkKDVeinngXm","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1670010188333,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"Sean McLean","userId":"07793442105541063961"}},"outputId":"c5ead4f6-dc3e-438e-8546-48ce1632927b"},"execution_count":75,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["song_id\n","8582    751\n","352     748\n","2220    713\n","1118    662\n","4152    652\n","5531    618\n","4448    609\n","6189    606\n","6293    583\n","1334    570\n","dtype: int64"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":75}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Most interacted users"],"metadata":{"id":"atRFkNVxH29B"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["most_rated = df_final.groupby('user_id').size().sort_values(ascending = False)[:10]\n","most_rated"],"metadata":{"id":"F3-iqRxnoHkE","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1670010188333,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Sean McLean","userId":"07793442105541063961"}},"outputId":"f461da9d-374e-4aaf-fade-ebdee342549b"},"execution_count":76,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["user_id\n","61472    243\n","15733    227\n","37049    202\n","9570     184\n","23337    177\n","10763    176\n","9097     175\n","26616    175\n","43041    174\n","65994    171\n","dtype: int64"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":76}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Observations and Insights:\n","\n","*   Despite a reduced dataset from the revised requirements put in place, there are still plenty of songs that have been played by users or have been seeked out by users to listen to and more than once.
