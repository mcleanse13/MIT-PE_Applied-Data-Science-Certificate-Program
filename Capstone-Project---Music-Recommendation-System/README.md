Project Overview: Music Recommendation System Using Collaborative Filtering & Clustering (Million Song Dataset)

This capstone project focuses on developing a Music Recommendation System designed to predict and suggest the top 10 songs a user is most likely to listen to. Using the Taste Profile Subset of the Million Song Dataset, the project simulates a real-world, end-to-end data science workflow—beginning with exploratory data analysis and progressing through model selection, evaluation, optimization, and business-oriented communication. The goal was not only to build an effective recommendation engine, but also to understand the trade-offs, assumptions, and constraints involved when designing solutions for large-scale consumer platforms like Spotify.

Across multiple milestones, the project explored data cleaning, user–item interaction filtering, clustering, similarity-based collaborative filtering, and content-based recommendation techniques. By comparing model performance, tuning hyperparameters, and assessing implementation feasibility, the work narrowed in on the approaches that produced the strongest and most interpretable results. Among the models tested, user–user collaborative filtering and cluster-based recommendation methods provided the best balance of predictive performance, scalability, and practical value, reflecting the importance of capturing behavioral similarity across listeners.

The final report and presentation synthesize technical findings, business insights, and recommendations for deploying the solution at scale. Key takeaways include the importance of filtering sparse interactions, the value of leveraging latent behavioral patterns, the need to continuously update models based on evolving listening trends, and the real-world considerations—such as bias, demographic differences, and shifting musical preferences—that influence how recommendation systems perform over time. Overall, this project provides a comprehensive demonstration of applied machine learning, analytical reasoning, and practical model development in the context of modern digital music streaming.
